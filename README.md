# Clifford and quadratic composite operator applications
The repo contains code to recreate the results in the paper Clifford and quadratic composite operators with applications to non-Hermitian physics by Garcia, Cerjan and Loring (2024).

Note: You may use the code and modify as needed, we just ask that you site the corresponding research paper.
